An argument could be made for either side depending on the needs of a website.  Also, responsive design is not widely implemented yet, so a lot of the results in Nielsen's report are base on users experiences on websites that were not built for mobile use. -->

When planning out your content, it's best to plan it out in a single column on a page, placing items in order of their importance.  Doing so gives you a very basic model of your mobile website.  There are several different strategies for content on the mobile web, check the resources for more information. -->

    <!-- When wireframing out a responsive site I would highly recommend doing the work in browser.   Some controversy around this subject.  For the University work, we wireframed every page we were redesigning.  This was only 9 pages, but it works out to 27 wireframes.  When revisions come, things get tough.  Building it in browser has benefits:
    
    - Iterative approach 
    - Get a better notion of breakpoints
    - Revise in one spot, update everywhere.

        So to make a summary of all the possible attributes used to position presentation steps, we have:
        
        * `data-x`, `data-y`, `data-z` - they define the position of **the center** of step element on
            the canvas in pixels; their default value is 0;
        * `data-rotate-x`, `data-rotate-y`, 'data-rotate-z`, `data-rotate` - they define the rotation of
            the element around given axis in degrees; their default value is 0; `data-rotate` and `data-rotate-z`
            are exactly the same;
        * `data-scale` - defines the scale of step element; default value is 1
        
        These values are used by impress.js in CSS transformation functions, so for more information consult
