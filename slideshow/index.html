        First of all, thanks for taking interest and reading 
        this.  This is my first time being in front of an 
        audience where I'm not screaming obscene lyrics in 
        their face!  Feel free to email me (laneolson@gmail.com)

      ABOUT ME
      ######################################################
      I'm currently working with University of Alberta's 
      University Digital Strategy Team to bring a responsive
      framework to the University to run their sites on.  
      The first preview will be available at the beginning
      of December.  In addition to design, I have also 
      "worked" some time as a musician.  Playing on 
      dumpsters wasn't very lucrative so I've been focusing
      most of my time on design these days.
      
      I built my first website in 1997, and it was 
      a Starcraft fan site.  It had a whole bunch of gifs,
      and I was especially stoked because I found the 
      "Starcraft" font online and was able to download and
      install it on my computer!

      1999
      ######################################################
      By the time 1999 came around, I got my first freelance
      web gig making templates for Ultimate Bulletin Board. 
      1999 was also awesome, because I think that's the year
      I was able to start designing for 800x600 resolutions!
       
      Some other notable things from 1999 were:
        - Y2K
        - Bullet time effects (Matrix!)
        - Google was in beta

      Back to the present!  In 2012, things have changed a 
      bit.  Bullet time effects are still awesome, but the
      rest are pretty different:
      
        - December 21, 2012 (End of Days)
        - Google is the second largest tech company in the world, next to Apple.
        - Instead of designing for 800x600, I'm designing for 320x480... all the way up to 2560x1600.
        
      To some designers, that might sound like a nightmare.
      In reality, it's not so bad. If you're wondering why
      you would have to consider such an absurd range of 
      resolutions when designing a website you had better 
      not stop reading here.

      Better, more powerful devices are coming out each day.

      less than 1% accessing the web on their mobile devices
      to over 11%, with no sign of slowing.

      Remember when the internet was something new? 
      AOL would ship out their propaganda CD's for dial-up 
      internet telling you how easy and inexpensive it is. 
      It didn't take long before everyone was bragging 
      about how they had access to the internet, similar to
      the way people currently brag about how they figured 
      out how to get US Netflix.  Now in 2012, the rate 
      of people gaining access to mobile enabled internet 
      devices is significantly higher than the adoption 
      rates for desktop internet were years ago.  There is 
      no sign of this rate leveling out yet either, as 
      people are continuously upgrading and getting new 
      devices.

      800x600 resolution.  Depending on your target audience
      you might need to support all of these devices.

      But... how do you support multiple devices?  One 
      approach is to build a separate mobile site for 
      your users. One usability studies has actually found 
      that mobile users have a higher success rate on 
      websites that offer a separate mobile version of 
      their site.

      JAKOB NIELSEN QUOTE 
      ######################################################
      Jakob Nielsen is a well known usabilty expert, in a 
      study earlier this year he defines a guideline that
      stated good mobile user experience requires a separate 
      site. 
      
      This post caused quite a bit of uproar in the design 
      community, and several blog posts popped up touting 
      responsive design being a more usable approach.  An 
      argument could be made for either side depending on 
      the needs of the website.  Also, responsive design is 
      not widely implemented yet, so a lot of the results in 
      Nielsen's report are based on users experiences on 
      websites that were not built for mobile use.  It also 
      heavily depends on implementation.  Obviously a poorly 
      designed separate mobile site is going to be a much
      worse experience than a well implemented fixed width 
      site.
      
      Nielsen also suggests that it could be justified to 
      even have a third separate site for tablet devices.

      DORITOS EXAMPLE 
      ######################################################
      Picture this:  I'm at home, relaxing, in my 
      sweatpants, watching TV.  Then, all of the sudden a 
      case of the munchies strikes.  I want Doritos, but I 
      don't know what kind.  I KNOW!  I'll check out what 
      kind of Doritos I can get on their website.
        
      I go to Doritos.com, and get this.  
      (img/doritos-mobile.png)

      This is the worst possible thing anyone has done in 
      the history of the internet.  Doritos has made a 
      separate mobile site, to tell people that they do not
      support mobile devices.
      
      This is a content parity issue.  When you have a 
      separate mobile site, you have to maintain two 
      websites worth of content instead of just one.

      If I had to summarize what responsive design is in one
      sentence (and I don't) it would be:  Responsive 
      Design is about providing the user with the best 
      experience possible,  no matter the device.  Why 
      penalize the user  for their preference of browsing 
      your site? Support my Grandpa's 800x600 CRT monitor, 
      or he'll call me.  Love the guy, but enough is 
      enough.

      IMPLEMENTATION
      ######################################################
      So, what's involved in building a responsive design? 
      A lot of coffee.  Initially you would go through a 
      requirements phase with the client to understand what 
      they need from their website.  With responsive design, 
      you also need to take into consideration which devices
      need to be supported.

    <!-- 
      
      START WITH CONTENT
      ######################################################
      The way you think about content needs to change for
      the responsive web.  People don't use their mobile
      device to just "surf" anymore, they are very goal 
      oriented.  When planning out your content, it's best
      to plan it out in a single column on a page, placing 
      items in order of their importance.  Doing so gives 
      you a very basic model of your mobile website. 
      Building content for the mobile web is a topic in 
      itself, so I'm not going in depth.  There are some 
      good resources in the further reading section.
      
      An interesting approach I've seen is taking a print 
      out of an existing design, cutting out the pieces, 
      and assemble them in a vertical fashion in order of
      priority.

      WIREFRAMING
      ######################################################
      When wireframing out a responsive site I would highly
      recommend doing the work in browser.   Some 
      controversy around this subject.  For the University 
      work, we wireframed every page we were redesigning.  
      This was only 9 pages, but it works out to 27 
      wireframes.  When revisions come, things get tough. 
      Building it in browser has many benefits:
      
      - Facilitates and iterative approach
      - Get a better notion of breakpoints in the design
      - Revise in one spot, updates for all devices.

    on all resolutions.  There are some patterns for how 
    to implement common page elements online, most with
    markup.

  MOBILE GUIDELINES
  ######################################################
  Mobile users need a simplified interface, they do not 
  have the precision of a mouse.  Touch screens also 
  have a variety of gestures, and a website should 
  utilize those whenever it is applicable.  However, it
  might be a good idea to provide a fallback for the
  user. Lastly, the page should be light weight for 
  mobile.  That means serving smaller images, using less 
  resource intensive javascript and also resource heavy
  css.
  
  With tablets,

  <div id="guidelines" class="step" data-x="-4000" data-y="4000" data-rotate="90">

      <ul style="font-size: 0.55em;" class="checklist">
        <li><i class="icon-ok"></i> Simple interface</li>
        <li><i class="icon-ok"></i> Utilize touch gestures when possible</li>
        <li><i class="icon-ok"></i> Lightweight (workload and file size)</li>
      </ul>

  META TAG
  ######################################################
  Now we can get into the actual build of the design.
  Start with the meta tag. The viewport meta tag tells the 
  browser that this page is intended to be viewed at 
  whatever the standard
  device width is for the page.  You may also specify 
  zoom settings in this meta tag.
  
  Sometimes images will look pixelated on a mobile 
  device.  That is because it is a higher resolution 
  screen and the browser is actually zooming in on the 
  page.

    MEDIA QUERIES
    ######################################################
    In order to make elements on the page move and shift 
    around at different resolutions, you need to specify
    resolution specific styles.  Media queries in CSS3 
    allow you to do that.  You can specify min-width
    and max-width values for the media queries and the
    page will only use those styles when the browser
    matches the query.
    
  --> 
  <div class="step" data-x="-5000" data-y="1000" data-rotate="90">
  
      <p>CSS3 Media Queries</p>
      <pre class="prettyprint">
/* BASE STYLING */

@media only screen and (min-width: 481px) {
  /* LARGER MOBILE DEVICES */
}

@media only screen and (min-width: 768px) {
  /* TABLET &amp; SMALLER LAPTOPS */
}

@media only screen and (min-width: 1030px) {
  /* DESKTOP */
}

@media only screen and (min-width: 1240px) {
  /* LARGE VIEWING SIZE */

       only screen and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.5) {
  /* RETINA (2x RESOLUTION DEVICES) */
}

  HANDLING IMAGES & MEDIA
  ######################################################
  How to handle images in a responsive design has also 
  been a hot topic within the community.  There is 
  agreement that mobile users should be served a smaller
  image size than desktop users, but there is some 
  argument over the best way to implement it.
  
  Some use server side solutions, like adaptive images, 
   to generate different sizes of images for different 
  devices. This requires no markup changes.
  
  Another method is to define alternate resolutions for
  images in data attributes on the image tag and using
  javascript to swap out the image based on the device.
  
  Use fitvids for maintaining aspect ratios!
