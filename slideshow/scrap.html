When planning out your content, it's best to plan it out in a single column on a page, placing items in order of their importance.  Doing so gives you a very basic model of your mobile website.  There are several different strategies for content on the mobile web, check the resources for more information. -->

            I'm building a simple blog site for myself where I just want to post the occasional entry whenever I feel like writing.
          
            On the homepage I've decided I'm going to want:
            
              - Title
              - Navigation
              - Search
                - Latest post
                - List of the 5 most recent posts
                - Categories
                - Archive
              - Footer

      <h2>Wireframing</h2>
      
      <!-- Wireframing in responsive design is a bit more complex, because instead of building one wireframe for a page, you need one for each device you are going to support.  You could do this is in whichever program you prefer, but I would advise building up the wireframes in a browser.  
        
          - Iterative approach 
          - Get a better notion of breakpoints
          - Revise in one spot
