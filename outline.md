1.  Talk about who I am.
2.  Talk about my past experience, and how needs have changed from
    back when we had 640x480 resolutions to now, where we have a 
    huge variety of devices.  (relate 1999 styles to 2012 styles)
3.  Go into some mobile stats:
      - Mobile browsing will overtake desktop browsing by 2014.
      - Stats about mobile only internet users.
      - Stats about mobile usage types and times.
      - Show how these stats impact the viewer.
4.  Okay, so targeting people on these devices is important, so 
    how do you do it?
      - Separate Mobile Site
        - Content Parity
        - Tablets?!
        - Arguments of stripped down website: If you can reach
          the goals of the website with a stripped down version
          of the content, why not use that subset for the desktop? 
5.  Responsive Design!
      - Responsive design is the idea that you build one website 
        that adapts, or responds, to whichever device you choose 
        to view it on.
      - Desktop = Happy. Tablet = Happy. Mobile = Happy.
      - Examples
      - Your goal is to provide the user the best interface possible
        for the device they are using.
      - Uses the same markup for all versions, but you shift and adjust
        the design (with css) based on the resolution is is being viewed at.
6.  Where do I start?
      a.  Information Architecture
          - Build based on goals for website
      b.  Content
          - Prioritize, minimal amount of content required, 1 column page.
          - Simple, light weight.
          - Paper to responsive, and other resources.
          - Homepage example (latest blog post, 5 latest entries, archive)
      c.  Wireframing
            - NOTE: I recommend wireframing, and designing in browser.  Using photoshop
             is good for quick little mockups, but designing in the browser will
             save time (one revision instead of 3)
          - Determine which devices you want to customize interfaces for.
          - Work your way from the smallest up to the largest resolution.
          - Shift page elements around on page, restyle as desired.
          - Be careful about introducing new types of content
          - Wireframing resources
      d.  Implementation
          - Responsive Design consists of three things
            - The meta tag
            - CSS3 media queries
      e.  Building it.
          - Mobile View
          - Tablet Specific Styling
          - Desktop Specific Styling
      f.  Handling Images and Video
          - Sizing
          - Serving alternate image sizes
          - Resources and plugins
      g.  Layout (Navigation and Patterns)
      h.  Fallbacks and Browser Compatibility
          - IE6/7/8 (modernizr)
      i.  Additional Topics
          - Bring in addition content as required, do not hide content.
          - 
      j.  Frameworks
          - Bootstrap
          - Foundation
          - Skeleton
          - Bones
          - jQuery Mobile
